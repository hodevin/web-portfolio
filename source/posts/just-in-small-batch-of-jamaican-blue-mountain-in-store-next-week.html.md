Back in February, when Supreme‘s Spring/Summer 2019 look-book and preview dropped, the internet was particularly psyched about the brand’s upcoming Hot Wheels collaboration. Finally, today, we’ll get to relive our childhoods when the season’s must-have accessory drops.

## A little history on Hot Wheels

The Hot Wheels Team Transport pack contains a Supreme-branded scale model Fleet Flyer and 1992 BMW M3 with custom license plates and the ’90s-era Hot Wheels logo on the packaging.
The Supreme x Hot Wheels collaboration will be available online and at Supreme’s New York, Los Angeles, London, and Paris stores later today, April 18, at 11 a.m. EDT and BST (12 p.m. CEST).

>Hot Wheels was first introduced in 1968 to the toy industry during NEW YORK TOY FAIR. Although Mattel, which is based in California, both Supreme and Hot Wheels began in New York.
