Adidas is planning to release the black color of the Adidas Yeezy 350 V2 on June 22nd, 2019.

## The history behind Kanye West and his Yeezy's

### Nike

In April of 2009, Kanye West worked with Nike to produce the first ever shoe under Kanye's name: The Nike Air Yeezy 1. 5 years later, Kanye and Nike released the Air Yeezy 2, dubbed the "Red Octobers".

However, Kanye would soon part ways with his partnership with Nike due to some outstanding circumstances.

### Adidas

Kanye said that Nike refused to pay royalties on the Nike Air Yeezys. Additionally, Adidas offered him full creative reign over his sneaker design as well as much more money than what Nike offered.

For a design piece that became popular, Adidas Yeezy's were not always mass produced. The original Adidas Yeezy 350 V1 (Version 1) were produced in much smaller quantities. This means that the market price will go up, since there is a low supply and high demand. This is mostly influenced by the hype that drives the price up in the streetwear community. The streetwear culture revolves around building hype in order to create a market "value", which means that exclusive and popular brands will have a **resell** value. Potentially, the **resell** price may be higher than the **retail** price by a significant amount.
