  The Supreme Fall/Winter 2017 was the brand’s largest and most diverse collections ever. It was filled with a heavy mixture of old looks along with brand new designs. Here we see the return of the Supreme Arabic Logo Long Sleeve Tee. The brand has a few different versions of their logo with the Arabic and Kanji versions previously seen earlier in the year. The F/W 2017 release saw the long sleeve tee in new colorways for the fans. The classic cotton Supreme long sleeve tee in bright lime is the foundation of the piece. The Arabic logo graphic was then printed across the chest in black. Eight different color options were available with lime being a unique colorway. The simple look can be easily matched with headwear or by itself or layered with other tops. You really can’t go wrong with the Supreme Arabic Logo Long Sleeve. Rhianna has been spotted wearing the same piece but in the black colorway whereas Travis Scott enjoys the hoodie version. The piece dropped online and at most Supreme shops outside of the Japan market on December 14th 2017 for $44. Check for your size and favorite colorway on the marketplace.
